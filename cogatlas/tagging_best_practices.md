#### So you want to be a semantic swami? a cognitive caper? sounds splendid!
#### We will teach you how to “Cognitive Atlas!”

##### Step 1: You start with a behavioral or cognitive phenomena that you are interested in studying. 
If you are a neuroimaging researcher, you will likely study this phenomena in the fMRI scanner. If you are a psychologist, you may measure this phenomena with behavioral assessments. 

##### Step 2: You then design an experiment to measure the phenomena. 
This experiment we call a “task,” and it can be broken up into different pieces, “conditions” that each may ask your experiment participant to do or respond to some particular stimuli. When you take those responses, whether they be actions in an fMRI machine or answers to questions, and perform numerical operations over them, the result of these operations we call a “contrast,” and it is the contrast that may represent one or more cognitive processes (“concepts”). For example, a personality assessment (task) may have different questions (conditions) that we sum up to final scores (contrasts) that each “get at” one or more different cognitive concepts (“emotion,” “decision making,” etc). 

##### Step 3: It’s only meaningful to do this kind of assessment if we can use a standard vocabulary 
for our tasks, contrasts, and concepts. This is where the Cognitive Atlas comes in - it is a standard terminology for cognitive neuroscience. This means that we want to map our definitions into the Cognitive Atlas so that future researchers can use them and critique them, and we can be sure that when I talk about something like “memory,” someone else that talks about “memory” is referring to the same thing.

##### Step 4: The Cognitive Atlas is a public, open source resource, which means that it is like wikipedia in that its development is driven by its users. 
You are the expert! This means that when you have your experiment and develop the conditions and contrasts, you must figure out how your experiment fits into the Cognitive Atlas: 

###### First, find your task
You can use the search functionality of the web interface to see if your task, or a similar task, is already defined that you can work with. There are a few possible options here:
- It could be that your task is already defined, and you simply need to tag your new data with it. This would be great!
- It could be that there is a similar task to your own, but it’s not exactly right. You have three options:
  - fork a definition: which means making a slight variation of the task
  - duplicate the task entity: which means making a “child” term. For example, a “stroop task with blue elves” may be a descendent of “stroop task” 
  - define an entire new task: means that there are no strong associations with existing tasks, and you want to define a new one.


###### Second, define conditions and contrasts
If you define a new task, you will be able to fill in all the associated task fields, meaning conditions, contrasts, implementations, references, and external datasets. If you are modifying or forking a task, some of this work may already be done for you, or require critique. Each task has an area for discussion, and you start a discussion with other users of the Cognitive Atlas about changes to the task. Please see our other content/video [TODO] about the details/fields of the task definitions.

######  Third, make assertions between contrasts and concepts
This is the hard part, and where you should get your lab and peers involved. We recommend that you:
 - make a spreadsheet of all your tasks and associated contrasts
arrange a regularly meeting group / meeting to associate contrasts with concepts. Again, there are several possibilities here:
 - a concept may already be defined in the Cognitive Atlas. Great!
 - a concept may be defined, but the definition needs work, or the relationships to other concepts (eg, what if you found “working memory” in the Cognitive Atlas, but no assertion was made that “working memory” is a kind of “memory?” You would want to add that.
 - The quality of the atlas is 100% reliant on this careful work, so we recommend that you bring together your lab, or engage other users in discussion about these contributions.

###### Finally, make inferences!
We have provided several tools for you to make inferences about the relationship of your data to others based on semantic similarity. More information about these methods and tools will be available soon.
