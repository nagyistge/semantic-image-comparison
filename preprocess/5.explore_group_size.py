# We want to investigate how changing the size of the set for comparison (the "in" set) 
#     influences the outcome. We will select ?(a subset) of concepts with many tagged images, 
#     and at each size of the "in" set (from 1..N) calculate a score for each held out image.

# For each concept, (N=140):
#    Select a number G from 1...[total "in" group] as the size of the set to investigate
#        For each image in (entire) "in"set:
#            For some number of iterations:
#                Randomly select G other images for "in" set, calculate P(concept|image)
#                Take mean score of iterations as P(concept|image)
